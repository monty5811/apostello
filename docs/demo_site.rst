Demo Site
=========

There is a demo site available at https://apostello-demo.herokuapp.com

You can login with the email `test@example.com` and the password `apostello`.

Note that:

* All the data is reset every hour
* You cannot send or receive messages as there are no Twilio credentials
* No emails can be sent either (so signing up as new user will not work)
* You can only login with email, not with Google
* The demo site is running on the free tier of Heroku, so it may be unavailable as it needs to sleep 6 hours everyday
